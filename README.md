# Project: Rock'n Paper

This game is created and developed by the ProgrammingPICNIC community from Twitch.  It is a reskin on the classic Rock/Paper/Scissors game. The choices are instead Magic/Ranged/Melee where Magic deals bonus damage to Melee, Ranged deals bonus damage to Magic, and Melee deals bonus damage to Ranged. The game consists of two players who each start with 100 health points. Each round both players are damaged. The game continues while both players have health remaining.
